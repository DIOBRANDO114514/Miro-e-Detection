# Miro-e-Detection
TestN.py  is the final visual run and video recording script. Model import from https://github.com/noobjection/Miro-e-Vision, created by our group member Dongjian Ma.

train.py is a previous attempt to train a model on its own, which worked OK but was difficult to deploy to a robot.

yolo-hand-gestures-detection is the original model training full file reference.
